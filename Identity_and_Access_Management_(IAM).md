## Identity Access Management (IAM) 

IAM allows administrators to control who has access to specific resources. An IAM policy includes a "who" section, a "can do what" section, and a "on which resource" section. The "who" part identifies the user or users you're referring to. A Google account, a Google group, a Service account, an entire G Suite, or a Cloud Identity domain can be used to define the "who" part of an IAM policy. An IAM role defines the "can do what" part. An IAM role is a grouping of permissions. Most of the time, more than one permission is required to perform any meaningful operation. To manage instances in a project, for example, you must create, delete, start, stop, and change instances. As a result, the permissions are grouped together into a role, making them easier to manage. An IAM policy's "who" clause can refer to a Google account, a Google group, a Service account, or an entire G Suite or Cloud Identity domain.

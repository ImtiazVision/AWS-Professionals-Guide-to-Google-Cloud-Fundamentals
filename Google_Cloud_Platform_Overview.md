### Cloud Computing 

**Cloud Computing**: Cloud computing is a method of using IT that has these five equally significant characteristics: 

   - **On-demand self-service** : There is no need for human intervention to obtain resources. We acquire computer resources on demand and self-service. All we have to do is utilize a simple interface to access the processing power, storage, and network we want without the need for human interaction.
   - **Broad network access** : Accessible from any location. We can access these resources over the internet from anywhere we desire.
   - **Resource pooling** : The provider distributes resources to its clients. The resource supplier has a large pool of them and allocates them to consumers from that pool. This enables the supplier to achieve economies of scale by purchasing in bulk and pass on the savings to the clients. Customers do not need to know or care where such resources are physically located.
   - **Rapid elasticity** : As needed, obtain additional resources immediately. The resources are elastic; if we require more resources, we can obtain them rapidly; if we require less resources, we can scale back.
   - **Measured service** : We simply pay for what we use. Customers simply pay for what they use or reserve on the spot. They stop paying if they stop consuming resources.

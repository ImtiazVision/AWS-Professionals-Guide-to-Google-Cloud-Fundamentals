## GCP Computing Architechture

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** and **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** were introduced as a result of **virtualized data centers**.

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** : IaaS products provide raw compute, storage, and network in data center-like configurations. In the IaaS approach, we only pay for what we allocate/use.


**Platform as a Service (PaaS)** : PaaS services tie our application code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure that our application requires. We may then concentrate only on our application logic.  In the PaaS model, we pay for what we use (pay per usage).


**Software as a Service (SaaS)** : Google's major apps, such as Search, Gmail, Docs, and Drive, are Software as a Service applications in the sense that end users consume them directly through the internet.

### Difference between Google Cloud and AWS : 

Both Google and AWS employ regions to deliver Cloud services to clients. However, AWS has distinct regions and zones than Google Cloud.


**Google Cloud**: Each area is made up of zones that are near to one another. Google provides multi-regional, global, and zonal services. It also employs zones to offer data center services, with at least three zones in each area.
  
**AWS** : One region is made up of multiple Availability Zones that are near to each other. AWS provides high availability via the deployment of clusters and data centers known as availability zones. There will be at least two availability zones in each location. Most services are regional or zonal in nature, but Cloudfront is worldwide.

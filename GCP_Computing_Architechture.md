## GCP Computing Architechture

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) were introduced as a result of virtualized data centers.

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** : IaaS products provide raw compute, storage, and network in data center-like configurations. In the IaaS approach, we only pay for what we allocate.


**Platform as a Service (PaaS)** : PaaS services tie our application code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure our application requires. We may then concentrate only on our application logic.  In the PaaS model, we pay for what we use.


**Software as a Service (SaaS)** : Google's major apps, such as Search, Gmail, Docs, and Drive, are Software as a Service applications in the sense that end users consume them directly through the internet.
